# DESCRIPTION

üå¶Ô∏è Weather Data Dashboard using Python, OpenWeatherMap API, and Matplotlib
This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet effective Weather Visualization Dashboard using Python. It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data for a city (in this case, Mumbai) and presents the information visually using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to provide a beginner-friendly walkthrough of working with APIs and data visualization libraries in Python, making it suitable for students, interns, and anyone beginning their journey into data science and Python development.

üîç Project Overview
The main objective of this task is to extract current weather data from a public API and create a visual representation of key parameters. This is done in the form of a simple dashboard that provides insights into temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall weather condition for the selected city.

This project is developed as a part of an internship assignment that focuses on:

Learning how to interact with REST APIs using Python (requests module)

Understanding how to parse JSON responses from APIs

Creating data frames using pandas for structured analysis

Building bar charts and pie charts using matplotlib and seaborn for clear and effective visualizations

Running all steps in a Jupyter Notebook, which allows step-by-step execution, inline output, and clean presentation

üìà What the Notebook Covers
The Jupyter Notebook is organized into the following key sections:

Library Imports
Essential Python libraries are imported at the beginning, including requests, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn.

Fetching Weather Data
A GET request is made to the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name and a personal API key. The API responds with a JSON object containing detailed weather information.

Parsing the JSON Response
From the JSON object, specific data fields are extracted such as:

Temperature in ¬∞C

Humidity percentage

Wind speed in meters per second

Weather description (e.g., "clear sky")

Displaying Weather Data
The extracted data is printed in a clean and readable format in the notebook output.

Data Structuring using Pandas
The extracted weather values are stored in a DataFrame to make them compatible for plotting with visualization libraries.

Data Visualization
Two types of visualizations are provided:

Bar Chart: To compare different weather parameters numerically.

Pie Chart: To show proportional distribution of the parameters.

Conclusion
The notebook concludes with clear, colorful, and interactive visuals that summarize the current weather conditions for Mumbai.
